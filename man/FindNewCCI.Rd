\arguments{
\item{seu.obj}{A Seurat object containing the single-cell RNA-seq data.}

\item{latent.ligands}{A vector of latent ligand gene symbols that are hypothesized to be involved in cell-cell communication.}

\description{
This function performs a detailed analysis of cell-cell interactions (CCI) in single-cell RNA sequencing data using latent ligand-receptor pairs. The function integrates cell type information and differentially expressed genes to identify potential cell-cell interactions. It uses the CellChat database and the wilcoxauc method from Presto for differential expression analysis.
}
\details{
This function operates as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Differential expression analysis is performed on the target cell type using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test via the \code{presto::wilcoxauc()} function.
\item Genes are filtered based on log fold change, percentage difference, and adjusted p-value cutoffs.
\item Receptor genes are identified from the latent ligand-receptor pairs and filtered from the differentially expressed genes.
\item A custom ligand-receptor interaction database is created using the provided latent ligands and the receptors identified from differentially expressed genes.
\item The function creates a \code{CellChat} object from the Seurat objectâ€™s expression data and metadata.
\item The custom ligand-receptor database is applied, and the CellChat pipeline is executed to identify overexpressed genes and interactions, compute communication probabilities, and aggregate interaction networks.
}

The function returns a CellChat object that can be further used for visualizing and interpreting cell-cell communication.
